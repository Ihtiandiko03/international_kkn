                            western region of Indonesia to jointly conduct Real Work 
                            Lecture activities. In the implementation of the first 
                            International KKNB activity, the Sumatra Institute of Technology 
                            was appointed as the host.</p>

                            ”. Tourism is one of the potential sources of state income, so its 
                            sustainability needs to be maintained so that state income from 
                            the tourism sector remains optimal. In line with the theme, the 
                            location of the International Joint KKN is an area with high 
                            tourism potential in North Sumatra. The implementation of this 
                            International KKNB is expected to increase soft skills
                            participating students and the internationalization of each PTN
